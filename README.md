# Image-Processing-With-Open-CV
**Requirements: A Linux (Ubuntu) (Preferred) or Windows Machine with a webcam.**
<br>
In this project we have used open-cv to find and focus on any color and then used that to remove static color background from webcam feed
<br>
**Python pakages:**
1. import cv2 ( pip install opencv-python )
2. import numpy ( pip install numpy )

**FindTheBack.py**
* This program will give you the feed of the camera and we can chose the color we want to focus and remove using the the GUI controler
* Once you get the color that you want to remove then close the gui screens and you will get the upper and lower bound color that you will need

**Remove_Replace_Background.py**
* Replace the uper bound and lower bound with the numbers we got in the GUI and run the code
* Now your camera feed will remove those colors and replace it with the bg-image

**Output Images**
